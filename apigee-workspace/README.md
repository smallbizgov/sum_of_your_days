# apigee-workspace Documentation

## Overview
The `apigee-workspace` is designed to manage and deploy API proxies, shared flows, and policies within the Apigee platform. This workspace contains all necessary configurations and files to facilitate the development and deployment of APIs.

## Project Structure
The workspace is organized into the following directories:

- **apiproxies**: Contains the API proxy configurations.
  - **sample-proxy**: A sample API proxy with the following files:
    - `apiproxy.xml`: Defines the API proxy configuration.
    - `proxy-endpoints.xml`: Specifies the proxy endpoints.
    - `target-endpoints.xml`: Outlines the target endpoints for the API proxy.

- **sharedflows**: Contains shared flow configurations.
  - **sample-sharedflow**: A sample shared flow with the following file:
    - `sharedflow.xml`: Contains the configuration for the shared flow.

- **policies**: Contains policy definitions.
  - `sample-policy.xml`: Defines a reusable policy for API proxies or shared flows.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `apigee-workspace` directory.
3. Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.
4. Deploy the API proxies, shared flows, and policies to your Apigee environment as per your requirements.

## Usage Guidelines
- Modify the XML files in the `apiproxies`, `sharedflows`, and `policies` directories as needed to customize your API configurations.
- Use the provided sample files as a reference for creating additional proxies, shared flows, and policies.
